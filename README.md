# Penny Web

Penny (http://mypenny.co) is a free tool to help people split complicated group expenses with their friends. The service is launched in 2016 and 
getting more and more popular nowadays because it's so easy to use. Not like other group expense tool, Penny doesn't
require sign up or login. You just need to share the URL to your friends, then everyone can start filling the expense they paid 
from their own device. In the meantime, the settlement will be calculated automatically to guide you how to pay out.

Just like the backend, I've open sourced this web UI of Penny in 2018. The single page application is written in React, Redux and Semantic-UI. 
The amazing Webpack and Babel also help to make it happen.
